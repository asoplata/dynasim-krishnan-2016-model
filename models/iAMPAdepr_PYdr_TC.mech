% # iAMPAdepr_PYdr_TC: Normalized synaptic AMPAergic excitatory current,
%     with synaptic depression, FROM the thalamocortical cell TO pyramidal
%     dendrite PYdr<-TC connection used in the DynaSim implementation of
%     (Krishnan et al., 2016). Note that in the original code, the class for
%     this current is called AMPA_D2, and PYdr are called CX or CX_DEND. Also
%     note that, instead of using a Heaviside increase in transmitter
%     concentration upon spike detection, we used the (1 + tanh(V/4))
%     formulation from (Ermentrout & Kopell, 1998) for our spike detector and
%     transmitter concentration model.

% Parameters
%
% For the TC to PYdr connection, the conductance is given by the original
%     paper "absolutely" as 0.02 uS. We first need to normalize this value over
%     the area of the target cell and convert the conductance to mS/cm^2. We do
%     this by converting uS to mS and dividing by the area of the target PYdr
%     compartments:
%
%    0.02 uS * (1 mS / 1000 uS) * (1 / (165*1e-6 cm^2)) = 0.12 mS/cm^2
%
gAMPA = 0.12 % mS/cm^2
EAMPA = 0    % mV
sAMPAIC = 0.1
sAMPANoiseIC = 0.1
deprAMPAIC = 0.9
deprAMPANoiseIC = 0.1

% Note that alpha rate here corresponds to the inverse of the rise  time constant, 1/tauR, and
%        the beta rate here corresponds to the inverse of the decay time constant, 1/tauD
alpha = 1.1  % ms^-1
beta  = 0.19 % ms^-1

% In the original code, this sleep stage experimental factor is represented by
%     `fac_AMPA_D2`
fac_AMPAdepr_PYdr_TC = 0.396

% This is our DynaSim-varied, cell-type-NONspecific adjustment factor
fac_AMPA_cort_large_vary = 0

% Synaptic depression:
% The proportion of total "resources" used in each action potential
% In the original code, this is `Use`
resUse = 0.07  % unitless
% In the original code, this is `Tr`
tauRecov = 700 % in ms

% Connective radius, aka how many target cells each source cell connects to,
%     from the source's perspective.
radius = 10

% We also need to normalize the conductance in mS/cm^2 by the number of
%     connections each target cell is receiving on average, so that the TOTAL sum
%     of their conductive inputs adds to our overall maximal conductance above.
normalizingFactor = min(((2*radius + 1) / (N_post/N_pre)), N_pre)

% Functions
% Keep connections to compartment with the same index
removeRecurrentBool = 0
% Note that what is passed is 2x the radius
netcon = netconNearestNeighbors(2*radius, N_pre, N_post, removeRecurrentBool)

IAMPAdepr_PYdr_TC(X,s,depr) = -(fac_AMPAdepr_PYdr_TC+fac_AMPA_cort_large_vary)*gAMPA/normalizingFactor.*((depr.*s)*netcon).*(X-EAMPA)
