% Parameters
gNa = 90     % mS/cm^2
ENa = 50     % mV

% In the original code, vShift is called `Vtr` and is initially set as -50 in
%     the currents.h INaK current constructor, but later changed to -40 in the
%     CellSyn.h TCcore constructor. Also note that, while voltage shifts are
%     usually simply positive values added to the voltage in the alpha and beta
%     rate equations, in the original code of this current, each alpha/beta
%     usage of voltage is (v - Vtr) where Vtr is negative, which is what we do
%     below.
vShift = -40 % mV

mNaIC = 0.01
mNaNoiseIC = 0.1
hNaIC = 0.01
hNaNoiseIC = 0.1

% Note: In the original code, the temperature adjustment factor `Phi` comes out
%     to be 1, since the temperature is the same as the reference temperature
%     (36 C). Therefore it is unnecessary to calculate.

% Functions
