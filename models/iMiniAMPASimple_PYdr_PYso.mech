% # iMiniAMPASimple_PYdr_PYso: Normalized synaptic randomized "mini" AMPAergic
%     excitatory current FROM the pyramidal axo-soma compartment TO pyramidal
%     dendrite PYdr<-PYso connection used in the DynaSim implementation of
%     (Krishnan et al., 2016). Note that in the original code, the class for
%     this current is called AMPA_D2, PYso are called CX or CX_SOMA, and PYdr
%     are called CX or CX_DEND. Also note that, instead of using a Heaviside
%     increase in transmitter concentration upon spike detection, we used the
%     (1 + tanh(V/4)) formulation from (Ermentrout & Kopell, 1998) for our
%     spike detector and transmitter concentration model.

% Parameters
%
% For the PYso to PYdr connection, the conductance is given by the original
%     paper "absolutely" as 0.033 uS. We first need to normalize this value over
%     the area of the target cell and convert the conductance to mS/cm^2. We do
%     this by converting uS to mS and dividing by the area of the target PYdr
%     cells:
%
%    0.033 uS * (1 mS / 1000 uS) * (1 / (165e-6 cm^2)) = 0.2 mS/cm^2
%
gMiniAMPA = 0.2 % mS/cm^2
EAMPA = 0        % mV
% poisson parameters
baseline=0;     % sp/s, baseline rate
DC=10;          % sp/s, steady component of the signal
AC=0;           % sp/s, oscillatory component of the signal
f=0;            % Hz, modulation frequency of the signal
phi=0;          % radians, phase at which the signal begins
onset=0;        % ms, start time of signal
