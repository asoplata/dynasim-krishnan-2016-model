% # iAMPA_TRN_TC: Normalized synaptic AMPAergic excitatory current FROM the
%     thalamocortical cell TO nucleus reticular thalamic cell TRN<-TC
%     connection used in the DynaSim implementation of (Krishnan et al., 2016).
%     Note that in the original code, the class for this current is called
%     AMPA, and TRN cells are called RE cells. Also note that, instead of using
%     a Heaviside increase in transmitter concentration upon spike detection,
%     we used the (1 + tanh(V/4)) formulation from (Ermentrout & Kopell, 1998)
%     for our spike detector and transmitter concentration model.

% Parameters
%
% For the TC to TRN (RE) connection, the conductance is given by the original
%     paper "absolutely" as 0.05 uS. We first need to normalize this value over
%     the area of the target cell and convert the conductance to mS/cm^2. We do
%     this by converting uS to mS and dividing by the area of the target TRN
%     neurons:
%
%    0.05 uS * (1 mS / 1000 uS) * (1 / 1.43e-4 cm^2)) = 0.35 mS/cm^2
%
gAMPA = 0.35 % mS/cm^2
EAMPA = 0    % mV
sAMPAIC = 0.1
sAMPANoiseIC = 0.1

% Note that alpha rate here corresponds to the inverse of the rise  time constant, 1/tauR, and
%        the beta rate here corresponds to the inverse of the decay time constant, 1/tauD
alpha = 1.1  % ms^-1
beta  = 0.19 % ms^-1

% In the original code, this sleep stage experimental factor is represented by
%     `fac_AMPA_TC`
fac_AMPA_TRN_TC = 0.5

% Connective radius, aka how many target cells each source cell connects to,
%     from the source's perspective.
radius = 8

% We also need to normalize the conductance in mS/cm^2 by the number of
%     connections each target cell is receiving on average, so that the TOTAL sum
%     of their conductive inputs adds to our overall maximal conductance above.
normalizingFactor = min(((2*radius + 1) / (N_post/N_pre)), N_pre)


% Functions
% Keep connections to compartment with the same index
removeRecurrentBool = 0
% Note that what is passed is 2x the radius
netcon = netconNearestNeighbors(2*radius, N_pre, N_post, removeRecurrentBool)

IAMPA_TRN_TC(X,s) = -fac_AMPA_TRN_TC*gAMPA/normalizingFactor.*(s*netcon).*(X-EAMPA)

% This way we record the synaptic currents!
monitor IAMPA_TRN_TC


% ODEs and ICs
s' = alpha.*(1 + tanh(X_pre./4)).*(1-s) - beta.*s
s(0) = sAMPAIC+sAMPANoiseIC.*rand(1,N_pre)
