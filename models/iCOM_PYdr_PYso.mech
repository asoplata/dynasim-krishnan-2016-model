% # iCOM_PYdr_PYso: Simple ohmic axial current for connecting FROM PY cell
%     axo-somatic compartments TO PY cell dendritic compartments PYdr<-PYso
%     used in the DynaSim implementation of (Krishnan et al., 2016). Note that
%     in the original code, this cell type is called CX, and the compartments
%     are called CX_DEND or CX_SOMA. This mechanism should be used twice, once
%     for dendrite to soma, and once for soma to dendrite.

% Parameters
% Since DynaSim uses maximal conductances in units "mS/cm^2" for all currents,
%     including connective ones, we have to convert the conductancee. The
%     original paper cites (Mainen & Sejnowski, 1996) for most of this
%     derivation. (Krishnan et al., 2016), its predecessors, and its code give
%     the resistance between compartments as a variable "kappa", which is 10
%     MOhm = 10e3 kOhm. The area of the soma compartment is given as 100 um^2 =
%     1e-6 cm^2 in (Mainen & Sejnowski, 1996), while the area of the dendrite
%     compartment is given as a multiple "rho" of the soma compartment area,
%     where rho = 165 in the code for (Krishnan et al., 2016). In the original
%     code, it seems the dendritic area was used to calculate the conductance
%     of the connection. Since conductance in mSiemens is the reciprocal of
%     resistance in kOhms, we can convert to mS/cm^2 using:
%
%     1 / (kappa=10e3 kOhm) * 1 / (rho=165 * S_CX_SOMA=1e-6 cm^2) = 0.6 mS/cm^2
gCOM=0.6

% Functions
% Note that this is the same as -gCOM * (Vdr - Vso) = gCOM * (Vso - Vdr)
ICOM_PYdr_PYso(IN,OUT) = gCOM.*(IN-OUT)
