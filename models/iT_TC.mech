% # iT_TC: T-type Low-threshold Calcium current, Hodgkin-Huxley-style,
%     for generic thalamocortical compartments, corresponding to CaV 3.1, used
%     in the DynaSim implementation of (Krishnan et al., 2016). Note that in
%     the original code, this current is called IT_TC, and in the original
%     paper it is called iLCa. Additionally, the ICa identifier in the original
%     code refers to the calcium buffer concentration dynamics, NOT the calcium
%     current.
%
% - Note: In the original code, this current uses two state variables "m" and
%     "h", but this is different from the original T-current implementation in
%     (Destexhe et al., 1996) which uses the "m_inf" in place of integrating an
%     "m" differential equation.
%
% - Source: This was built from the original paper's code, using "currents.h"
%     lines 346-361,"currents.cpp" lines 143-162, and "CellSyn.h" line 60.

% The Q10 temperature adjustment values never change over the course of the
%     simulations, so we are setting them to be constant.
phiM = 3.55^((36-24)/10)   % unitless Q10 value of temperature adjustment
phiH = 3.0^((36-24)/10)    % unitless Q10 value of temperature adjustment

% ODEs and ICs
mT' = (Minf(X)-mT)./tauM(X)

hT' = (Hinf(X)-hT)./tauH(X)
hT(0)=hTIC+hTNoiseIC.*rand(1,Npop)

% Interface
% Note: Usually in DynaSim, the current is made negative before being assigned
%     to a linker, but in this case, the below is less confusing since exposing
%     IT_TC for the CaBuffer_TC mechanism requires a
%     not-made-negative version of IT_TC.
@current += -IT_TC(X,mT,hT,CaBuffer_TC)
@IT_TC += IT_TC(X,mT,hT,CaBuffer_TC)
