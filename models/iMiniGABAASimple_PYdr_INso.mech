% # iMiniGABAASimple_PYdr_INso: Normalized synaptic randomized "mini" GABA-Aergic
%     inhibitory current FROM the interneuron axo-soma compartment TO pyramidal
%     dendrite PYdr<-INso connection used in the DynaSim implementation of
%     (Krishnan et al., 2016). Note that in the original code, the class for
%     this current is called GABA_A_D2, INso are called CX, CX_SOMA, IN, or
%     FS1, and PYdr are called CX or CX_DEND. Also note that, instead of using
%     a Heaviside increase in transmitter concentration upon spike detection,
%     we used the (1 + tanh(V/4)) formulation from (Ermentrout & Kopell, 1998)
%     for our spike detector and transmitter concentration model.

% Parameters
%
% For the INso to PYdr connection, the conductance is given by the original
%     paper "absolutely" as 0.02 uS. We first need to normalize this value over
%     the area of the target cell and convert the conductance to mS/cm^2. We do
%     this by converting uS to mS and dividing by the area of the target PYdr
%     cells:
%
%    0.02 uS * (1 mS / 1000 uS) * (1 / (165e-6 cm^2)) = 0.12 mS/cm^2
%
gMiniGABAA = 0.12 % mS/cm^2
EGABAA = -70        % mV

% poisson parameters
baseline=0;     % sp/s, baseline rate
DC=10;          % sp/s, steady component of the signal
AC=0;           % sp/s, oscillatory component of the signal
f=0;            % Hz, modulation frequency of the signal
phi=0;          % radians, phase at which the signal begins
onset=0;        % ms, start time of signal
offset=inf;     % ms, stop time of signal
tau=2;          % ms, synaptic time constant
