% # iK_TRN: Fast potassium current, for generic thalamic reticular cells used
%     in the DynaSim implementation of (Krishnan et al., 2016). Note that in
%     the original code, this celltype is called RE, and this current is called
%     INaK.

% Parameters
gK = 10      % mS/cm^2
EK = -95     % mV
% In the original code, vShift is called `VtrK` and is initially set as -50 in
%     the currents.h INaK current constructor. Also note that, while voltage
%     shifts are usually simply positive values added to the voltage in the
%     alpha and beta rate equations, in the original code of this current, each
%     alpha/beta usage of voltage is (v - VtrK) where Vtr is negative, which is
%     what we do below.
vShift = -50 % mV

nKIC = 0.1
nKNoiseIC = 0.1

% Note: In the original code, the temperature adjustment factor `Phi` comes out
%     to be 1, since the temperature is the same as the reference temperature
%     (36 C). Therefore it is unnecessary to calculate.

% Functions
alphaN(X) = 0.032.*(15 - (X-vShift))./(exp((15 - (X-vShift))./5) - 1)
betaN(X) = 0.5.*exp((10 - (X-vShift))./40)
tauN(X) = 1./(alphaN(X) + betaN(X))
Ninf(X) = alphaN(X)./(alphaN(X) + betaN(X))
IK_TRN(X,nK) = -gK.*nK.^4.*(X-EK)
