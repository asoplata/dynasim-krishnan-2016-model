% # iM_INdr: Slow voltage-dependent non-inactivating potassium current,
%     for generic interneuron dendrite compartments used in the DynaSim
%     implementation of (Krishnan et al., 2016). Note that in the original
%     code, this compartment/cell type is called CX, CX_DEND, and sometimes IN,
%     and this current is called IKm_CX, while in the paper it is called IKm.

% - Source: This was built from the original paper's code, using "currents.h"
%     lines 451-468, 1210 and "currents.cpp" lines 240-251. This seems to be
%     built from (Mainen & Sejnowski, 1996, Nature).

qa = 9      % ???, unknown meaning
% The Q10 temperature adjustment values never change over the course of the
%     simulations, so we are setting them to be constant.
