% In the original code, the activation curve shift from experimental effects
%     `fac_gh_TC` is undefined in the currents.cpp current constructor, but is
%     shifted depending on the experimental condition in main.cpp lines 49-52.
%     Note that this is NOT the variable called `Shift` in Ih_TC, which is the
%     variable for the permanent, unchanging shift in voltage to make the
%     equations easier to calculate (and which is 0). Additionally, even the
%     variable is originally called `fac_gh_TC`, it does NOT change the
%     conductance, but instead the position of the activation curve.
fac_shift_H_TC = -2 % mV

% Note: In the original code, the temperature adjustment factor `Phi` comes out
%     to be 1, since the temperature is the same as the reference temperature
%     (36 C). Therefore it is unnecessary to calculate.
