%     dendrite compartments TO PY cell axo-somatic compartments PYso<-PYdr used
%     in the DynaSim implementation of (Krishnan et al., 2016). Note that in
%     the original code, this cell type is called CX, and the compartments are
%     called CX_DEND or CX_SOMA.

% Note that, due to the "reduced form" used in the PYso's master equations, it
%     is significantly easier to understand how the system is calculated by
%     doing all of the conversions in the master equation rather than
%     separately in nonstandard methods in the mechanism files. In other words,
%     trust me that this setup, including this handling of the dendritic
%     voltage, is the easiest to understand.
voltageFunction(IN) = IN

@voltage += voltageFunction(IN)
