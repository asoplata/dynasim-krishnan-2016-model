% Parameters
%
% For the TRN (RE) to TC connection, the conductance is given by the original
%     paper "absolutely" as 0.02 uS. However, in the original code, the value
%     is given in unknown units as 0.000002, but we will begin by using the
%     paper value. We first need to normalize this value over the area of the
%     target cell and convert the conductance to mS/cm^2. We do this by
%     converting uS to mS and dividing by the area of the target TC neurons:
%
%    0.02 uS * (1 mS / 1000 uS) * (1 / 2.9e-4 cm^2)) = 0.07 mS/cm^2
%
gGABAB = 0.07  % mS/cm^2
EGABAB = -95   % mV
rGABABIC = 0.1
rGABABNoiseIC = 0.1
gGABABIC = 0.1
gGABABNoiseIC = 0.1

k1 = 0.5      % mM^{-1} ms^{-1}
k2 = 0.0012   % ms^{-1}
k3 = 0.1    % ms^{-1}
k4 = 0.034    % ms^{-1}

% In the original code, this sleep stage experimental factor is represented by
%     `fac_GABA_TC`
fac_GABAB_TC_TRN = 0.715

% This is our DynaSim-varied, cell-type-NONspecific adjustment factor
fac_GABA_thal_large_vary = 0

% Connective radius, aka how many target cells each source cell connects to,
%     from the source's perspective.
radius = 8

% We also need to normalize the conductance in mS/cm^2 by the number of
%     connections each target cell is receiving on average, so that the TOTAL sum
%     of their conductive inputs adds to our overall maximal conductance above.
normalizingFactor = min(((2*radius + 1) / (N_post/N_pre)), N_pre)


% Functions
% Keep connections to compartment with the same index
removeRecurrentBool = 0
% Note that what is passed is 2x the radius
netcon = netconNearestNeighbors(2*radius, N_pre, N_post, removeRecurrentBool)

IGABAB_TC_TRN(X,g) = -(fac_GABAB_TC_TRN+fac_GABA_thal_large_vary)*gGABAB/normalizingFactor.*((g.^4./(g.^4 + 100))*netcon).*(X-EGABAB)

% This way we record the synaptic currents!
