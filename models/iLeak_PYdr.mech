% # iLeak_PYdr: Chloride/general Leak current, Hodgkin-Huxley-style, for
%     generic pyramidal dendrite compartments used in the DynaSim
%     implementation of (Krishnan et al., 2016). Note that in the original
%     code, this compartment/cell type is called CX or CX_DEND, and this
%     current is defined using `G_l` and `E_l`.
